### Development workflow

Discord4J development is done over multiple branches, favoring our oldest supported branch first and then **merging**
changes forward. For this reason, it is likely that your PR should target that older maintenance branch instead of 
`master`.

As a general rule, if our stable releases are from `1.5.x` branch, changes should always target that. This allows
us to avoid backports and instead merge changes forward applying all needed changes to newer branches up to `master`.

On the other hand, if the change only affects `1.6.x` line, changes should target that branch, or `master` if it's the 
latest. For more information about our versions check our [docs](https://docs.discord4j.com/versions)
